## XSRF attack - Cross-Site Request Forgery

Cookie created on `bank.com`.
By mistake you visit site `evil.com`. This site has JS code that submits a form
<form action="https://bank.com/pay" to `bank.com`

Browser sends cookies every time you visit site `bank.com` even if the form was
submitted from `evil.com`.

### Solution
To avoid this issue, all forms generated by `bank.com` must have,
a so called `XSRF protection token`, that cannot be generated by `evil.com`
Such protection takes time to implement though.

### Solution No.2
We can use `samesite` option. If set to `samesite=strict`
then cookie is never sent if user comes from outside the same site.
